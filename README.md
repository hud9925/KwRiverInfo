# Grand River Data Explorer

A Flask- and PostgreSQL-powered web app for visualizing near-real-time hydrological data from the Grand River Conservation Authority (GRCA). Users can filter by sub-basin (Upper Grand, Lower Conestogo, etc.) in Central South-Western Ontario (centered around KW Region) and explore clustered station time-series on an interactive map.

## Live Demo

The app is deployed at  
ðŸ‘‰ https://kw-river-info.vercel.app/  
and serves up-to-the-minute station metadata and charts directly from the KiWIS API.

## Overview

- **Interactive Map**: A Leaflet-powered map showing clusters of river, reservoir, climate and water-quality stations across the Grand River watershed.
- **Time-Series Endpoints**: Flask REST endpoints that proxy KiWIS timeseries calls (discharge, stage, temperature, turbidity, etc.) with URL parameters like `?period=P1D`.
- **Detail Panels**: Click any station marker to view its latest readings and a dynamically generated chart of the requested period.
